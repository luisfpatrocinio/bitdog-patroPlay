This project, named PatroPlay, is firmware that turns a Raspberry Pi Pico W-based board (the BitDogLab) into a generic USB joystick. The core functionality is to act as a standard USB Human Interface Device (HID) game controller, implemented using the TinyUSB library within the Pico SDK. The firmware is written in C and uses a custom hardware abstraction library (PatroLibs) to read inputs from two push-buttons and a 2-axis (X/Y) analog stick. The code defines the necessary USB descriptors and a HID report descriptor to describe the joystick's capabilities (buttons and axes) to the host computer. The main loop continuously reads the sensor states and sends them to the host via HID reports.
